# Introduction
The objective of this project is to use a dataset to explore creating a machine learning method in python. As someone who is very interested in machine learning, I'm excited to learn more about how to implement a model in python. For this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle describing a spaceship based on the Titanic on which passengers are being randomly transported to an alternate universe. My goal is to answer the following research questions:
1. Are any of the features correlated?
2. Which of the features are most indicative of whether a passenger will be transported or not?
3. Can we predict if a passenger will be transported based on the feature variables using logistic regression?
4. How well did the model perform?
